  ## Description
  For this assignment, we built a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

  A software engineering team generator command line application was built. 
  * This project prompts the user to build an engineering team. An engineering team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns. 
  * This project generates a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster, when the user has completed building the team,. Each team member displays: 
    - Name
    - Role
    - ID
    - Role-specific property (Office Number, GitHub profile link, or School)
  - All unit tests pass.
